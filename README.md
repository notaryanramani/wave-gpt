# WaveGPT: GPT followed by WaveNet

- WaveNet: WaveNet is a deep generative model developed by DeepMind for producing high-quality raw audio waveforms(here we are using wavenet for text data generation). It uses dilated convolutions to capture long-range dependencies in data, allowing it to capture more information to generate text with a long context.

- GPT : GPT, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a type of deep learning model known for generating human-like text based on input prompts. It uses a Transformer architecture and is trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate natural language
